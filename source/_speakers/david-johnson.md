His data familiarities and usages are centered on Landsat imagery but also extend to similar mid-resolution systems like IRS, DMC, and Sentinel-2, in addition to more broad-scaled data sources like MODIS, AVHRR, and VIIRS. David is highly versed in spatial analysis, statistics, modeling, programming, cartography, GIS, image processing and classification. He is also a member of the Landsat Science Team and the US representative for the GEOGLAM initiative. Mr. Johnson has nearly 15 years of experience with USDA/NASS and over 20 years overall experience with remote sensing and GIS. Prior work involved contracting and consulting for other US federal agencies including EPA, NOAA, and USAID.
