Ry is an environmental geographer with expertise in geographic information science (GIS) and remote sensing. He holds a PhD in Geography from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he studied the spatial dynamics of environmental impact assessment, especially as they relate to questions of environmental injustice and human health risk. Before joining SkyTruth in 2017, Ry led the spatial science program at Defenders of Wildlife, using remotely-sensed imagery to track long-term changes in habitat quantity and quality, developing predictive spatial models to identify priority places for wildlife conservation and recovery, leveraging citizen scientists to improve what we know about wildlife and their habitats, and working to make wildlife-relevant spatial data and analyses more accessible and usable on the web.
