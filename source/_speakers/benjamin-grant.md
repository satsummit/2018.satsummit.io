Benjamin Grant is the founder of Daily Overview - an artistic, environmental, and educational project that uses aerial imagery to detail how human activity has shaped the landscape of our planet.

With more than 640,000 followers on Instagram alone, the project continues to evolve and enter into new mediums. Prints from the project have been exhibited at museums and galleries in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Munich, Tel Aviv, Barcelona, and Paris. Additionally, Benjamin's book OVERVIEW was published in October 2016 and has been translated into nine languages so far. He is currently working on a children's adaptation of the book, due for release in Fall 2019.
