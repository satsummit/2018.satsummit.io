Terri is a Senior Earth Observation Specialist at the Satellite Applications Catapult. Many moons ago she obtained an MSc in Remote Sensing and a BSc in Environmental Geography from University College London (UCL).
her main areas of interest lie in the use of geospatial data to help fulfil the UN Sustainable Development Agenda, by providing data driven solutions to global problems. Key areas include the sustainable use of global water resources, climate resilience and environmental monitoring to support sustainable global development. She is currently working on the UK Space Agency funded International Partnership Programme project ‘Common Sensing’ – which aims to improve climate and disaster risk resilience in Pacific Small-Island Developing Nations (Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands), using geospatial data. 

Having expertise in both SAR and optical remote sensing, Terri provides technical expertise on a variety of national and international projects which focus on exploiting Earth Observation data for the greater good. The industry is changing, as such it is important to recognise that the influx of big data should be addressed with efficient, cost effective solutions which are accessible to all. Innovative solutions emerging in response include the use of Analysis Ready Data (ARD), DataCubes and artificial intelligence. 

As a passionate science communicator, Terri undertakes outreach activities as a STEM Ambassador, and she is also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Terri has previously worked with the engineering consultancy Arup, and the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London. 

Outside of work Terri loves to travel, go snowboarding and generally be outdoors in nature.
