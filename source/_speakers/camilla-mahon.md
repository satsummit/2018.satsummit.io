Camilla works closely with Mapbox's BD and leadership teams on the data partnerships that make our imagery layers possible, and with our engineering teams to build our maps and execute on technical priorities. She helped build the foundation of both our Satellite & Unity teams at Mapbox. Being both a technical and a people lead, she ensures complex work is shipped on critical timelines.  

The Satellite team at Mapbox develops the global imagery layers of Mapboxâ€™s maps. Motivated by respect for our planet and the possibilities afforded by images and measurements of the Earth from space, they aim to foster a culture of learning and teaching, and to be excellent partners with environmental, humanitarian, open source, and open data communities.
