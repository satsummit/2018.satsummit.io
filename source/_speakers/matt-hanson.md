Matthew started his career with photography and imaging processing at the start of the digital consumer age in the early 90s. Now, with nearly 25 years experience working in remote sensing, he is excited to see the huge growth in not just imaging satellites in general, but satellites with publicly available data.

He attended his first FOSS4G conference in 2011, which started him on the path of open-source software. He has since contributed to a variety of geospatial projects and started a few more. Matthew is most recently working on improving the ways that end users can utilize imagery by developing a collection of tools (sat-utils) and working on the new SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) spec for standardizing geospatial data discovery and access.
