Dr. Temilola (Lola) Fatoyinbo Agueh is a Research Physical Scientist in the Biospheric Sciences Lab at NASA GSFC where she studies forest ecology and ecosystem structure using active remote sensing instruments. Lola received her Doctorate in Environmental sciences in 2008 with a focus on forest ecology of tropical wetlands. After her Ph.D, she received a NASA postdoctoral program fellowship at the Radar Science and Engineering Section at JPL, where her primary research focus was on using interferometric radar data to quantify tropical forest extent, height and biomass through the development of radar-lidar fusion algorithms. In 2010, Dr. Fatoyinbo joined Goddardâ€™s Biospheric Sciences Laboratory. Her current research focus is the fusion of optical, SAR and lidar data to quantify forest structure, biomass, extent and degradation. She is the Principal Investigator on the P-band EcoSAR SAR instrument and PI/CO-I on several other NASA-funded projects. In 2012 she was the recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering for her efforts on merging scientific priorities with advanced technology to develop innovative remote-sensing instrumentation for carbon-cycle and ecosystems science.
