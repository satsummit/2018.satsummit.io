Caroline Gevaert has spent the last four years investigating the use of drones for mapping deprived areas. After two Master's degrees, she took her expertise to the field (with a drone in hand) in 2015 to collect images to support urban upgrading projects in Kigali, Rwanda. She developed new machine learning algorithms influenced from the fields of computer vision, remote sensing and photogrammetry to automatically classify the data. Her interests lie in connecting state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with local knowledge. Current activities include collaboration with the Ramani Huria participatory mapping project to address flood vulnerability in Dar es Salaam, adapting cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to map slums and support urban resilience, and supporting the GFDRR OpenDRI initiative.
