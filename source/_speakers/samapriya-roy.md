Samapriya is a Ph.D. Candidate at Indiana University with focus on Geospatial and Remote Sensing applications and a Senior Developer Intern at Planet, working on building image processing and analysis pipelines and creating and sharing well-documented and repeatable workflows. My core interests include building interfaces and custom integrations for users to better use data and improve their approach toward analytics.

My core areas of interest for my research applications include land use and land cover applications, surface, and subsurface hydrology. I spend a large amount of time working with research and education groups, trying to build data integrations and repeatable research models. I am currently working on building a geospatial workbench and an open source manifest library for image ingestion and preprocessing for commercial and open source imagery. I will be finishing up my dissertation in the fall of 2018.
