Nancy S. Coleman is a passionate and experienced communicator leading purpose-driven organizations to tell stories that earn trust. She serves as vice president of Corporate Communications for Maxar Technologies, a leading global provider of advanced space technology solutions for commercial and government markets including satellites, Earth imagery, geospatial data and analytics.
In 2017 she led the establishment of a News Bureau at DigitalGlobe which provides pro bono support to top-tier media organizations to leverage electro optical and radar satellite imagery and analytics for high-value enterprise and investigative news reporting. The News Bureau has played a pivotal role in exposing the displacement and killing of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar; providing indisputable evidence of human trafficking and illegal fishing in an international court case; monitoring the growth of refugee camps in Uganda; chronicling the physical toll of wars in Iraq and Syria; and revealing the devastation of numerous natural disasters, including the California wildfires and hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma.

Most notably, the News Bureau provided the “smoking gun” image to the Associated Press (AP) that showed two trawlers loading slave-caught seafood onto a commercial cargo ship. As a result of the Seafood from Slaves investigation, more than 2,000 enslaved men were freed, U.S. law was changed and AP was awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
Nancy is propelled by the opportunity to apply space-based insights to enhance global transparency through trusted visual information delivered to the public and the media.

A 1993 Graduate of the American University in Washington D.C. with a degree in Public Communications, Ms. Coleman has held corporate marketing and communications positions at leading technology and information businesses.
