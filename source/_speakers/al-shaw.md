Al Shaw is a news applications developer at ProPublica. Equal parts designer, developer and reporter, he uses data and interactive graphics to cover environmental issues, natural disasters and politics. A year before Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston, Shaw was part of a team that produced the Peabody Award-winning project “Hell and High Water,” which warned of the region's vulnerability to coastal storms.
