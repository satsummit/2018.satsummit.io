Born in Slovenia, he studied Physics and co-founded Cosylab Inc. at age 21 - a company developing control systems for particle accelerators and large experiments in physics. In 2008 Grega became CEO and co-founder of Sinergise, specialising in software for advanced geospatial applications, which helped Europe to efficiently manage and control agriculture policy and introduce land administration systems to developing countries in Africa.

With his colleagues, they recognised the potential of open Copernicus earth observation data early, but soon hit a wall trying to use existing technologies to work with these large datasets. Deciding to do something about it, Sentinel Hub was born. A Copernicus Masters award winning service for processing and distribution of satellite data is exploiting AWS Public Datasets to provide seamless access to the data to more than 10,000 registered users, mostly web developers creating applications on top of remote sensing data.

After working with governmental clients in Balkan, Western Europe, Asia and Africa, Grega is now engulfed in building a global Internet business, which now processes two million requests every day.
