title: "Radiant Earth Foundation platform"
type: "Workshop Track: Analysis at Scale"
category:
date: "2018-09-20"
time: "09:00"
time_slot: "09:00"
duration:
room: Meridian D/E
summary: "Radiant Earth Foundation will demonstrate their open platform for satellite imagery analysis. Users can access several multi-spectral imagery through the platform including Landsat 8/7/5/4, Sentinel-2, MODIS and ISERV or upload drone and airborne-based imagery to analyze on the platform. Attendees will learn to use the web-based interface as well as the API to work with different imagery and apply analytics to extract intelligence. Machine learning efforts for creating open-source labelled satellite image libraries will be discussed, as well as using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for classification of different features on land. **Difficulty: Intermediate. Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of remote sensing & satellite imagery.**"
