summary: "Countries that have previously be unable to setup a space program, now have increasing ownership of satellites and sensors so that they can protect their boarders, track their natural resources, and monitor human development. A space program used to mean designing, owning and launching your own rockets and satellites, maintaining a ground network, and so much more. Today, it’s possible to partner for everything from satellite design, to launch, ground stations, downlink spectrum, satellite operations and data processing and analytics."
