title: "DataCubes and CommonSensing"
type: "Workshop Track: Analysis Ready Data"
category:
date: "2018-09-20"
time: "11:00"
time_slot: "11:00"
duration:
room: Meridian C
summary: "Participants will learn about how to access and exploit EO data stored in an Open Data Cube (ODC) to generate data related to the Sustainable Development Agenda. Data Cubes are a new way to store, organise, manage and analyse EO data. Data Cubes provide access to large spatio-temporal archives that are processed and organized to allow immediate analysis across time and across data sets with minimum user effort. This removes barriers to full exploitation of EO data and supports use by non-expert users. For this hands-on workshop we will discuss the ODC and it’s role in facilitating improved climate and disaster risk resilience in Small Island Developing States. The Radiant Earth Foundation will introduce the Common Sensing Project, and outline our vision for an open source solution that will be deployed in the SIDS. NASA CEOS will demonstrate the ODC, and attendees will have the chance to access a ‘Sentinel-1 Data Cube Playground’ for Samoa (Please bring your laptop!). **Difficulty: Intermediate. Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of satellite data. Knowledge about radar data and Python coding will yield advanced value.**"
