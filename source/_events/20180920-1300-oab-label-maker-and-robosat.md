title: "Label Maker and Robosat"
type: "Workshop Track: Machine Learning"
category:
date: "2018-09-20"
time: "13:00"
time_slot: "13:00"
duration:
room: Oceanic A/B
summary: "There are a handful of existing annotated datasets for satellite imagery, but they’re mostly limited to urban regions in Western countries. This presents a challenge when attempting to use machine learning algorithms in non-Western regions. This workshop will show you how to generate custom data for feature extraction from aerial and satellite imagery. We’ll use two open source tools, Label Maker and RobotSat, to prepare the data, train an algorithm, and predict over a test area. **Difficulty: Intermediate. Prerequisites: Basic understanding of machine learning, satellite imagery, and OpenStreetMap.**"
