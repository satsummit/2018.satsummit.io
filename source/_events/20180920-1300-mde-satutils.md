title: "sat-utils"
type: "Workshop Track: Analysis at Scale"
category:
date: "2018-09-20"
time: "13:00"
time_slot: "13:00"
duration:
room: Meridian D/E
summary: "The session aims to demonstrate to participants how to use the sat-utils collection of tools to discover and access publicly available imagery such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. The latest versions of sat-utils take advantage of the new SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) spec, which enables a standardized workflow for discovery and processing of data, regardless of the sensor it is from. Several sat-utils programs will be explored over the course of the workshop. Sat-api is an easily deployable infrastructure to run your own STAC compliant API. We run a public version of sat-api for all the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data on AWS. Sat-search is a library and command line tool for searching and downloading data from sat-api, while sat-fetch allows for downloading just your area of interest. During this workshop you will learn how to use these tools to quickly find Landat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery for any AOI, and fetch the data for processing."
