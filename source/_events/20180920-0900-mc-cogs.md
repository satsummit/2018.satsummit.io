time_slot: "09:00"
duration:
room: Meridian C
summary: "The Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format is a way to store satellite data to allow for fast web access and cloud analysis at scale. Adopted widely by the Earth on AWS effort, it immediately enabled new forms of access and use of imagery data. We will share Mapbox’s experience working with COGs. We’ll also cover how to create them from other formats and how to use them in your application. **Difficulty: Introductory/Intermediate. Prerequisites: Python & GDAL knowledge helpful to work on personal data/computer.**"
